    "# Notes - Ideas for Imporovement\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. SCORE Component (Goals, Assists)\n",
    "# Current Approach: Goals (0.75), Assist1 (0.715), Assist2 (0.555).\n",
    "# - ADD A SIMILAR WEIGHTING SYSTEM TO THE SHOTS COMPONENT\n",
    "# - Will regular a deep sql query but I want to identify games with ahigh impact on the game - goals that tie a game of put a team +1.\n",
    "# - I'm also thinking of giving a bonus to unnassisted goals - otherwise they are worth less tot hte teams overall score and the goal scorer should be rewarded for the individual effort\n",
    "\n",
    "# - SHORTHANDED POINTS - Should be worth a bigt bonus as they are huge in the game\n",
    "\n",
    "# Suggested Improvements:\n",
    "# Situation-Specific Weighting: Increase the weight for goals and assists in high-pressure situations, such as late-game scenarios, during close games, or in key power play/penalty kill moments.\n",
    "# Positional Consideration: Adjust weights based on the player's position. For example, goals by defensemen could carry a higher weight due to their relative rarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. SHOTS Component (Shots On/Off Net, Blocked)\n",
    "# Current Approach: Same weight (0.075) for all shot types.\n",
    "# Adjust blocked shots, they shouldn't be a negative as they are but they should be less than shots on net\n",
    "# - Take a look at the weight - find way to justify. maybe OnNet-100 offnet-75 blocked-25\n",
    "# - Weight by Situation - CLOSE_GAME = 100, PP = 75, # Remaining EVEN Strength SHots = 50\n",
    "# Suggested Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Contextual Weighting: Adjust weights based on game situation, like shots during power plays or close_game - both are in data\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. FACEOFFS Component (Wins, Losses)\n",
    "# Current Approach: Equal weight (0.01) for wins and losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Suggested Improvements:\n",
    "# Increase the current weight - add more weight to Close, PP and PK faceoffs if possible\n",
    "# Don't have the ability to diff face off success by zone or game time (e.g., late in a close game)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. TEAM Component (Goals For/Against While on Ice)\n",
    "# - Just use the redily available plus/minus data and weigh it the old way - UNTIL something better is available\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 5. PENALTIES Component (Penalties Taken)\n",
    "# Current Approach: Weighted by the overall PP% for entire dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "# Suggested Improvements:\n",
    "# Weighted by the opposing team's power play success rate.\n",
    "# Type of Penalty: Differentiate between minor and major penalties, as they have different impacts on the game.\n",
    "# Timing of Penalty: Penalties taken in critical moments (e.g., late in a close game) could have a higher negative weight.\n",
    "#  - IDEA: Maybe Disregard penalties when the other team takes one at the same time\n",

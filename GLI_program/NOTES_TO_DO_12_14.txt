- make plots of PP and KIll numbers

- re work by line plots to half pages - fonts need to be reworked

- adjust font sizes on all schedules, rosters, ags tables 

- Fix matching between roster (Last, First) names and the names from scraped box scores so matching with number and position works better
	- create dataframe for GLI program with Roster and basic stats + AGS as in example

		- create the DF for each team in python and format with excel

	- column aranagment should have player number, name, position, G, A, Pts, +/-, PIM, AGS THEN the rest of biographic info from roster table
		- Want to simplify or seperate State into a different column to control spacing more
			- also need to get that data clean to make the map / heat map of the states the participants come from like I would like to

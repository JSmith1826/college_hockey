Great Lakes Invitational Ticket Holder Agreement
The bearer of this ticket ("Ticket Holder") is granted access to the Great Lakes Invitational at Van Andel Arena ("Event") subject to the following terms, which are agreed to by the Ticket Holder in exchange for the thrill of live hockey action. 
By using this ticket, the Ticket Holder agrees to cheer responsibly, indulge in concession stand delights at their own risk, and participate in the wave only when initiated by someone under the age of 12 or over the age of 60. Please note the improved ambiance, a direct correlation to the absence of a certain team from Ann Arbor and their particularly obnoxious followers. The Ticket Holder also acknowledges that any pucks, sticks, or other objects flying into the spectator area can cause serious enjoyment. 
Any attempt to explain the offside rule to a non-hockey fan is strictly voluntary and at the Ticket Holderâ€™s own peril. Van Andel Arena is not liable for any confusion or accidental hockey fandom that may ensue. Remember, "Tell 'em Tim sent you" has no actual bearing on this agreement, but feel free to invoke it for a fleeting sense of VIP status.

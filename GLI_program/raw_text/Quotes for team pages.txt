Most MSU hockey fans I know harbor a strange hatred for Michigan Tech. As far as I know the Huskies hate NMU too much to consider us all that often -TerranMonarch

 They always get so strangely defensive about it when I mentioned Tech, but I don't think I ever once thought about them. -GentSyke (MTU)

Yeah I have family ties to MSU’s football team so I hope they right the ship. What a disaster that is right now.

Michigan Tech, hands down.

They had a pregame party open to everyone that included free beer!

Missed it last year, looking forward to not hearing the Michigan alumni band play the same three songs

MICH FAN - Did we pull out, or did Northern Michigan Tech not invite us because of Mel?

From what we know it was a mix of the shenanigans that were pulled in the 2021-22 GLI regarding your school and Western Michigan/Mel and your school's athletic director not seeing eye to eye with everyone.

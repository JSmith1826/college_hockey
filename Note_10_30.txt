	- this will require some sql magic I think. now sure where to grab the data from
- Face offs - not exactly sure how to do this yet

- Longer Term - create dictionary with all team abreviation, color and logo information, store as seperate file that can be imported
	- Will need to refactor most blocks of code but will be worth it - ulivate goal is to just need to inpuit the folder name, 2 team names and background image info
	- might end up being easier to create different dictionaries for each property

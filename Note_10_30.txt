TO Do In College Hockey Project

- Title images / team comparision
- last years reacord, current year record, roster turnover rate, draft picks on roster
	- scratch notebook has code to create dataframe source for image
	- still need to add last year records and current year record

- DONE - Add Tags on every chart for "All Data From College Hockey News" and Created by [github_logo] JSmith1826

NOTES FOR ADAPTABLE MATCHUP BOOK
DONE - Reduce line weith on box and whisker by 1
- add outline to the box plots at the bottom of notebook
- Apply outline to the bar charts that don't have them (match the line style of the box and whisker) 
	- Changed the code but it is not working - need to address

- New chart for age and experience

- New Chart for Special Teams (Scatter with PP% over PK%
	- this will require some sql magic I think. now sure where to grab the data from
- Face offs - not exactly sure how to plot this yet - maybe try to break them down by line?

- Longer Term - create dictionary with all team abreviation, color and logo information, store as seperate file that can be imported
	- Will need to refactor most blocks of code but will be worth it - ulivate goal is to just need to inpuit the folder name, 2 team names and background image info
	- might end up being easier to create different dictionaries for each property

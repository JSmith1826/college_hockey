5. Maine Black Bears

The University of Maine's beloved mascot, Bananas T. Bear, has a rich history that dates back over a century, deeply intertwined with the university's athletic and community traditions. Initially, the mascot wasn't a person in a suit but a real, living black bear, a tradition that started in 1914 and involved more than 16 different bears over a 51-year period. This era of live bear mascots began when a black bear cub named Jeff was presented to the university's football team, marking the beginning of a tradition that would define the university's spirit for decades. The name "Bananas" originated from an enthusiastic crowd reaction at a football rally, where the bear's antics had the audience going "bananas," thus giving rise to the mascot's enduring name​​​​.

However, the practice of using live bear mascots concluded in 1966 when a Maine court outlawed the tradition. Since then, Bananas has been represented by a student in a bear costume, continuing to embody the spirit and pride of the University of Maine at athletic events, community gatherings, and beyond. The transition from live animals to a costumed mascot reflects changes in societal attitudes toward animal rights and welfare, while preserving the essence and tradition of the university's mascot. The first Bananas suit was crafted in 1969, featuring a paper-mache head and genuine bear paws, marking the beginning of the "human bear" era for the university's mascot​​​​.

Throughout the years, the Bananas mascot has undergone several transformations to maintain its spirited presence and adapt to the times, including changes to the costume design to better represent UMaine pride and engage the community. From leading the band and performing stunts at football games to joining the cheerleading squad and participating in community outreach, Bananas T. Bear has remained an integral part of the university's identity, bringing joy and unity to students, alumni, and fans alike​​.

The story of Bananas T. Bear is a testament to the enduring spirit and evolving traditions of the University of Maine, symbolizing a century of community, athleticism, and pride.
